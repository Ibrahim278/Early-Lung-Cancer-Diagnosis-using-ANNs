# Early-Lung-Cancer-Diagnosis-using-ANNs
This project focuses on developing an ANN Model for Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis

Worked on my 4-month thesis on detecting early lung cancer using ANNs. The aim of the project was to train and test a robust Deep Learning Model that can assist radiologists in detecting lung cancer by scanning X-Rays and CT Scans. The datasets used in this project are publicly available on the LIDC-IDRI Database.

The tools and technologies used in this study are:
 - Python
 - Jupyter Notebook
 - Google Colab 
 - Kaggle Notebooks

The 1st month of the study included a thorough literature review of existing work. The 2nd month involved data collection and pre-processing. The 3rd month was about training the model on various datasets. The 4th month included testing the model on the test sets and comparing the model to the work discussed in the literature and lastly the last stage of the study was writing up the thesis report.
